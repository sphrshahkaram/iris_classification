# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview##

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline using the Iris dataset. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species based on their features. 

## Features##

 **Data Loading**: Utilizes the scikit-learn dataset and converts it into a pandas DataFrame.
 **Preprocessing**: Includes data scaling and train-test splitting.
**Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses PCA to reduce the dataset to 2D for visualization.
**Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest Classifier and evaluates its performance.
**Visualization**: Plots PCA results to visualize the dataset in reduced dimensions.

## Installation##

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
